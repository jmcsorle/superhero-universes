# Superhero Universes - Mod 3 Showcase

## Abstract:
Superhero Universes is an app that uses the [superhero-api](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/). This API is a "Multiple universes superheroes open-source REST API." The purpose of the application is to help budding comic book enthusiasts test their knowledge of characters in Marvel and DC comic books. When a user opens the app, they are given the opportunity to choose a random hero or a random villain. Once they have made a selection, details of the character are provided. The user can further interact with the app by selecting whether the character is from the Marvel Universe or the DC Universe. Once they make a selection, they are given feedback and shown some additional details about the character.
